    }
  },
  blocks: [
    {
      x: number, // 0-99
      y: number, // 0-99
      z: number, // 0-49
      type: "string", // determines hatch pattern
      layer: "string"
    }
  ],
  blockTypes: [
    {
      name: "string",
      color: "string",
      hatchPattern: "solid|diagonal|cross|dots|brick|etc"
    }

## Technical Challenges & Solutions

### Challenge 1: 3D Rendering Performance

### Challenge 2: Cross-View Data Consistency
**Solution:** Maintain single 3D dataset, render different projections, sync selections and edits across views

### Challenge 3: Hatch Pattern Performance
**Solution:** Efficient pattern generation using WebGL shaders, cached pattern textures for repeated use

### Challenge 4: Height Level Navigation UX
**Solution:** Clear visual indicators, ghost blocks for other levels, intuitive level switching controls (0-49 range)

### Challenge 5: 3D Rendering with Blueprint Feel
**Solution:** Solid rendering with clean edges, subtle shading, hatch patterns maintained in 3D view

### Challenge 6: Large Build Performance (100x100x50)
**Solution:** Implement octree spatial indexing, frustum culling, and efficient batch rendering

## User Experience Considerations

## Next Steps

1. **Finalize scope** - Review and adjust this plan based on feedback
2. **Create wireframes** - Design specific UI layouts
3. **Set up development environment** - Choose tools and project structure
4. **Build Phase 1 prototype** - Start with basic functionality
5. **Iterate based on testing** - Regular feedback and improvements

## Design Decisions Made

### Block Type System
- **Start with generic block types** (Block A, Block B, etc.) for initial development and testing
- **Support 5-6 different types initially** to keep MVP focused
- **User-definable block types** can be added in future phases
- **Future consideration**: Minecraft-specific block types (Stone, Wood, Glass) in Phase 5

### Hatch Pattern System
- **5-6 basic patterns for MVP**: solid fill, diagonal lines, cross-hatch, dots, brick pattern
- **Predefined patterns initially** - custom pattern creation is future enhancement
- **Simple, clean patterns** that work well at different zoom levels
- **3D view**: Hatch patterns render as solid colors with subtle shading for performance

### Height Level Navigation
- **Simple +/- button controls** for level navigation (most intuitive for MVP)
- **Clear current level indicator** in UI
- **Ghost block visualization** for blocks on other levels (lower opacity)
- **Future enhancement**: Slider or direct numeric input for power users

### 3D View Rendering Style
- **Clean solid rendering** with subtle ambient lighting
- **Simple shading** to show depth without overwhelming the blueprint aesthetic
- **Hatch patterns as solid colors** in 3D view to maintain performance
- **Clean edges** and minimal visual noise

### Export Formats (Initial)
- **PNG export** for 2D views (primary format)
- **Screenshot capability** for 3D view
- **Future additions**: PDF for technical drawings, material list generation

## Remaining Open Questions

- How should we handle memory management for builds approaching 500,000 blocks?
- Should elevation views include basic depth shading to show building form?
- What keyboard shortcuts would be most valuable for power users?
